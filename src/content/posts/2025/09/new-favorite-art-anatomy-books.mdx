These are my new favorite art anatomy books!
This a pair of books called **Point Character Drawing** by Taco *([@taco1704](https://www.instagram.com/taco1704/) on Instagram and Twitter)*, who is a Korean artist I've seen once in a while, but I had no idea they also made an art anatomy book like this.

I actually used to save a lot of their art tips on their Instagram when I was active there around the time, but I wasn't following their account much to where I had any idea they made a book.
Since I still use their art tips even now, I thought I'd buy the set!

The two books are purchased as a set.
The first one is more focused on the body shapes and arms, while the second one is more focused on faces and legs.
Skimming through the book, it still felt nice seeing some of the art tips in a physical medium that I still reference today in my own work.

I normally don't buy as many art books as I used to in the past when I was still learning as a beginner.
Most art books usually take up physical space, plus are not convenient to open up and reference.
On top of that, I end up not using the book anymore because either I found a more comfortable art style,
or I just didn't want to pull up the book since it was inconvenient in the middle of drawing
(versus using my phone or my computer to pull up reference images which are much faster).

I was never against the idea of physical art tutorial books, but rather it just doesn't work out in my own space.
Especially when my only work area is small, there's only so much space on the bookshelf or other storage places before I run out.

That being said, I still bought these books. I use their art tips from the book (and hopefully will continue to use them) in my own art to this day,
and I want to continue doing so. Taco's art style is more on the anime-like side, and I would reccomend these books if you want more anatomy tips in that style.

This was an anatomy tip from the book that I still use when I draw torsos and bodies.
Using boxes for drawing the body has been a lifesaver instead of rounder shapes if I need to know where the character is facing or placed.
