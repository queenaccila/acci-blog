I got Moho Pro after seeing the cool 2D rigging and general tools to make things a lot easier for animation.
I'm hoping to make some more fun animation stuff down the line when I get a better feel of how to use Moho.

Moho Pro is honestly pretty fun to work with!
I really liked how easy it was to create shapes and basic movement once I figured out how to use the smart dial rigs and line boil tools.

So here's Sakamoto from Nichijou (My Ordinary Life) since his design was pretty easy to draw!
