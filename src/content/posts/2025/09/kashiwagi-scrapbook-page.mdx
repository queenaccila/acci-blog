## Making a scrapbook page

I have a new journal after my old one got all of the pages filled up. My old journal had a very decorative design, and I wanted something similar so I've been using a binder to get a similar feel.
Part of my journal I also treat it like a scrapbook, and make fun decorative pages such as this one. I made it themed around Kashiwagi Osamu from Yakuza (Like A Dragon), and have more paper-like decorations to it.

I might make another post in the future about my new journal, as I've been trying some new things and love it so far!
I also made this to start off my video gallery, which can be viewed <Link to="/videos">here</Link>.
