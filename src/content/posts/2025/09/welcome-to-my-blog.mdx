## **My new blog is official!**

I've been working on this website for the past month now, and I'm really happy to see this website finally finished!
I'm still going to be updating this site, but I'm mainly more happy that I finished making this on my own and deploying it.

Now that I've finished making this website, I'm hoping to either work on more art, animation, games, or even more website projects.
I have so many ideas for future projects that I'm glad I can now use this blog to post my thoughts, processes, and general work of things I like making.

I'm excited to post more in the future!
And don't forget that if you ever want to send me anything, feel free to send it in my <Link to="/inbox">inbox</Link>!
