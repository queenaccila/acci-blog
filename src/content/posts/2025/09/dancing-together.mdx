Here is some old art of Acci and Kashiwagi Osamu! This art was done a couple years ago but I still really loved how this art turned out.
The top one is them from "present" day and the bottom one is from them meeting up years ago.

I made these to also kick off the art gallery section of my blog! You can see the page <Link to="/art">here</Link> which is similar to an Instagram layout.
