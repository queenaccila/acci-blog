## It's real!! It's finally happening!!

I can't believe it! Yakuza Kiwami 3 is actually coming out.
Not only that, but RGG Studios also announced another game called Dark Ties, which is focused around Mine Yoshikata!!

The original Yakuza 3 game was one of those games in the series that tends to get more hate than the others, mainly due to the combat.
I honestly can't blame other players for hating Yakuza 3 just because of that, as the combat itself is pretty stiff and enemies are constantly blocking you, even small enemies.
But I'm hoping with the Dragon Engine could help make the game combat feel much more smooth, as seeing how Kiwami 2 turned out, I have a lot of hope that Kiwami 3 will come out pretty well!

Looking at the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za9rjoTdG_M) and the game's [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/), there seems to be some interesting stuff I'm really looking forward to.

One of the things that stood out to me on the Steam page was how colorful Okinawa looks now.
This is probably the most obvious upgrade but I'm so happy the overall place is just so vibrant.

I definitely can't wait when it comes out!! The ragdoll physics are gonna go crazy with the updated combat.

As for Dark Ties, I think this is the main reason why I'm so enticed to actually preorder the game.
Yakuza 3 is one of those games where the story and characters carry a lot more than the combat, which is why I love it so much.

Mina Yoshikata is one of my favorite Yakuza antagonists, as the game originally gives him some hints of his backstory and his attachment to Daigo Dojima.
It makes his character feel more human, and not a typical antagonist in Yakuza that usually has self-centered reasons as motives.

Also as someone who shipped Mine and Daigo ever since I played Yakuza 3, you can imagine my reaction when I realized they were gonna make a DLC game focused entirely on Mine and how he met Daigo.
In the original game, Mine's backstory and how he met Daigo was vague but also gave enough details to know what happened.
But there was no cutscenes or any significant scenes of these two together, so I really can't wait to see these two actually meeting up.

If you've seen my [Minedai Kiss Simulator Game](https://queenaccila.itch.io/minedai-kiss-simulator) you probably picked up that I love these two.
I'm considering doing a remake of this game and also making a post about it!

RGG Studios really just had to put this on the Kiwami 3 Steam store page didn't they...

(Can't wait to see this cutscene in 4K resolution now and cry again)
