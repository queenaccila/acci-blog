I got the new Tamagotchi Paradise and I've been playing with it so much for the past couple weeks!

I haven't unlocked all of tamas, but that's been my main goal right now.
Most of the tamas I've gotten so far are so cute!! My favorites that I got so far are Mimitchi, Irukatchi, and Imoritchi (the one in the video)
