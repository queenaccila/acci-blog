I finally got around to playing A Hat In Time, and I loved it!!

This game is so simple, and I wish I got into this game when it came out, as I would've been so obsessed with it!
The characters have so much personality that it made me pretty attached to some of them.

Hat Kid was also surprisingly great as a character despite her never saying anything.
Facial expressions and body behavior on a character can really go a long way, and it really drives in the "show, don't tell" rule.
I think the fact you can do emotes as Hat Kid in the game also make it pretty funny too.

I might make more fanart in the future, but I thought I'd at least make some fanart right after I finished the game to get my art groove back.
