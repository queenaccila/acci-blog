## Play the game [here](https://queenaccila.itch.io/guiding-drift)

I recently worked on a new game for a game jam! This was for the IGDA California Clash Jam, and I wanted to make a simple, but fun game in GDevelop!

Since I also got and messed around with Moho Pro, I wanted to make a game where I can easily make animated assets that looked handdrawn.

## General Process

Since I was going to solo dev the whole game, and I only had a week to make the game, I needed to figure out what would be premade by someone else or me making them myself.
I wanted to test Moho to integrate in my game dev process, so I would be doing all of the art.
There were also some extensions in GDevelop that I could use in my process to cut down time on making the game logic.

For the audio, I decided to have that premade. Usually music and sound effects are not my strong suit, so I tend to use premade audio for my games.

## Moho Pro Art

When I was making assets in Moho, I mostly wanted to make a cozy vibe.
Using a textured flat art style, I was able to make something that emulated this type of art style.

## Putting Everything Together

Once all of the art is finished, I put everything together.
Of course, not everything would fit together smoothly.
The biggest thing that would need pretty heavy changes was the background of the moving river.
I didn't have a perfect tiled background, so the river moving would not be very smooth if I did an endless background.

But I managed to circumvent this by using GDevelop's object effects.
Using GDevelop's "Reflection" object effect, I was able to get the river to do a water movement effect.
This helped make the river effect move without having to do a manual tiled background.

*(I honestly feel like I need to take advantage of GDevelop effects more.
There's a lot of cool and fun effects built in that I want to use.)*

## Conclusion

For the longest time, I always seemed to struggle trying to make game jam entries and finish them on time.
I'm slowly coming to realize I would need to have some things on hand that are premade to cut down on time if I'm working solo.
Trying to do everything myself can be a lot more time consuming than I may measure it out to be.

I know that also means I'll have to think more creatively when it comes to making my own game jams, or even in my own personal games.
But I think that would be a fun approach to making my own games in the future!
